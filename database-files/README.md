The SQL schema provided creates a comprehensive database structure designed to manage and track student applications, career projections, co-op experiences, and job listings. It includes tables for students, hiring managers, companies, job listings, applications, and career timelines, with foreign key relationships to maintain referential integrity. Additionally, the system includes administrative functionality with permissions for students, employers, and administrators, as well as a logging system to track alerts and updates. The schema also accounts for data management through archiving, backup, and deletion, ensuring that historical information is preserved and easily retrievable. Through this design, the database facilitates the management of student career development, job applications, and employer interactions in a detailed and structured manner. To re-bootstrap the database, if there are connection errors, head to docker to run the mysql_db container. You can also rerun the sql file by doing docker compose down and docker compose up -d to get the most recent changes.

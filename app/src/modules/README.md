# `modules` Folder

Currently, we are using this folder to hold functionality that needs to be accessible to the entire application. `nav.py` is a module that supports our custom navigation bar on the left of the app along with some basic Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). 

# The nav.py file inside this folder allowed us to seamlessly transition from different pages in the website. There was always a way to get back to the Home page, or "escape"/restart so to say.
